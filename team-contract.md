  - reading the assigned material (as much as possible), and
  - coming with ideas pertaining to the tasks and decisions to be made.
- Members will not work on other assignments during meetings and will be engaged.
- Decisions can be made during meetings even if some members are absent, but everyone should be informed/inquired beforehand.
